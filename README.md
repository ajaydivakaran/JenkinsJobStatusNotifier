Jenkins Job status notifier
========================

Chrome plugin to show Jenkin's job statuses


Use-case
-----------------
As a lazy developer, I don't want to look at the build monitor or always login to Jenkin's dashboard page to know the statuses of the jobs.
Given I almost always have Chrome open, I want the browser to tell me when the currently configured jobs fail or a one-click link (icon near my address bar)
to tell me the job statuses.


Steps to install
----------------

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to chrome://extensions/
3. Enable Developer mode
4. Click on load unpacked extension
5. Select the folder where the repository is cloned to.

Post installation steps
-----------------------

1. Navigate to the options page.
2. Enter details
